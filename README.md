***What is fibonacci?
-The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that start with a one or a zero, followed by a one, and proceeds 
based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. 
If the Fibonacci sequence is denoted F (n), where n is the first term in the sequence, 
the following equation obtains for n = 0, where the first two terms are defined as 0 and 1 by convention:

F (0) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

***What is Recursion?
-A common computer programming tactic is to divide a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original, 
solve those sub-problems, and combine the results. This is often referred to as the divide-and-conquer method; 
when combined with a lookup table that stores the results of solving sub-problems 
(to avoid solving them repeatedly and incurring extra computation time), 
it can be referred to as dynamic programming or memoization.
